# LeetCode Python Locally ðŸ’»

[English](README.md) | [ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡](README.zh.md)

Welcome to the **LeetCode Python Locally** repository! This project is designed to help you solve, test, debug, and profile LeetCode problems directly on your local machine. Whether you're working offline, in a restricted environment, or simply want more control over the performance analysis of your solutions, this tool is perfect for you.

## Why Use This Repository?

### Speed and Control
On the LeetCode website, checking your solution is done through a web interface, which can sometimes be slow, depending on your network connection or whether you're a VIP member. By using this repository, you can check your solutions instantly, without any delays.

### Offline and Private
Sometimes, you may not have an internet connection, or you could be in a restricted office environment where coding on LeetCode is frowned upon. With this tool, you can simply copy the problem description and solution template into `solution.py`, and start solving problems without worrying about internet access or external scrutiny.

### Professional Performance Profiling
When you submit a solution on the LeetCode website and find that it's slower than others, it's often unclear why that is, especially if the reason isn't obvious. This repository offers a simple yet useful way to profile your solution using `-p`, helping you to understand performance bottlenecks in a professional manner.

## How to Use

### Requirements
For colorful output format, `colorma` is required:
```bash
pip install colorama
```

### Step 1: Copy the Problem Description
Copy the problem description and solution template from LeetCode (or any other source) into the `raw_text` section of `solution.py`.

### Step 2: Implement Your Solution
Write your Python solution in the provided `Solution` class within `solution.py`. 

### Step 3: Run the Solution
Run the `check_solution.py` script to test your solution against the provided examples.

```bash
python check_solution.py
```

**Example Output:**

```bash
Example 1
input: nums = [1,-2,3,-2]
expected output: 3
your output: 3
Accepted.
----------------------------------------

Example 2
input: nums = [5,-3,5]
expected output: 10
your output: 10
Accepted.
----------------------------------------

Example 3
input: nums = [-3,-2,-3]
expected output: -2
your output: -2
Accepted.
----------------------------------------

AC
Notice: Use `python check_solution.py -p` to check solution performance data.
```

### Step 4: Profile Your Solution (Optional)
If you want to understand why your solution might be slower than others, use the `-p` flag to enable performance profiling:

```bash
python check_solution.py -p
```

This will provide detailed performance data, helping you to optimize your solution.

    53         2       1000.0    500.0      3.2          return res
```

## Extra Requirements

To take full advantage of the profiling feature, you might need to install additional Python packages. Use `pip` to install them:

```bash
pip install line_profiler
```

If you don't have these libraries installed, the script will warn you and gracefully exit when you try to use the `-p` option.
