## 1. do some Leetcode silently at work... 

Just copy some text and code from Leetcode webpage like we did in `solution.py`, for convenience you may copy our `solution.py`  together with `check_result.py`, then just try type:

```python
python check_result.py
```

You will find it tell you what you really need when you want to let alone your work for a little time and only let yourself solve a Leetcode problem as:
